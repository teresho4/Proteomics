# Proteomics

Here you can find my python code for replication of the 'Dynamic organellar maps applied to EGF signalling' experiment from Daniel N Itzhak et al.
paper 'Global, quantitative and dynamic mapping of protein subcellular localization' (https://elifesciences.org/articles/16950).


*The code was written for the purpose of proteomics workshop.
